## Planning Your Mowing Routes in OxChief


There are 2 main steps necessary to define an area to mow: 

- first you define the outer perimeter
- then you define the obstacles within (i.e. the exclusion areas). 

To get these exactly right, you're going to want to record these while tracing them on your mower. 

After recording the mowing perimter and obstacles, you're going to note a few other important features of your run:
- the starting location
- the mowing path width
- the mowign path heading

OxChief has you covered from recording your mowing area to building the path at the exact heading and path width you desire.
